"""voxcaster — fire-and-forget local TTS narration over a Unix socket.

A small daemon that turns text lines into speech with `Kokoro
<https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro>`_, plus a zero-dependency client.
Designed for narrating long-running work (training runs, builds, pipelines)
without ever blocking or crashing the thing doing the work.

Quickstart::

    from voxcaster import speak
    speak("experiment finished")                 # fire-and-forget
    speak("loss is NaN — stopping", interrupt=True)
